# drawing-to-fsd-layout

A small script that converts a hand drawn track layout to a track layout that can be used in in Formula Student Driverless Simulators

It will turn this image ![before](media/before.png) into this ![after](media/after.png)

Clear hand-drawn tracks should also work. They do not have to be filled in.

The extracted track can be downloaded as a JSON file with x,y and color values are available for each cone (in compressed JSON format), as well as an LYT file that can be used in Live for Speed.
